## A repurposing of the Zendesk template for data science docs

### Details:

This repo is a repurposing of Zendesk's Github pages [repo](https://github.com/zendesk/jekyll-theme-zendesk-garden).  It has less total functionality than the original repo, but has added notes to make it a bit more accessible to those who, like me, want to minimize time spent understanding jekyll implementations.

Notes on usage: please see the index file in the docs directory [here](https://github.com/mgoold/ds_template/blob/main/docs/index.md).  It contains the startup content that would normally go in this readme page.

If you're interesting in using this template, it's probably bc of the sidebar and pagination, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/mgoold/ds_template/blob/main/docs/customization/sidebar.md).
